# Getting Started with SrvOS

This project is designed to work in combination with the Linux distribution [NixOS](https://nixos.org) or [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) on macOS.

In this documentation, we expect the reader to be already familiar with the base operating system, and introduce how to compose it with our own extensions.

For NixOS continue reading [here](./nixos/getting_started.md),
for nix-darwin/macOS read [this](./darwin/getting_started.md).
